<p class="description" style="color:white;">Addiction can affect people at any age, however it often begins in young people. Teenagers and young adults are at increased risk of substance use disorder. We understand that addiction does not discriminate and affects people at all stages of life. We also recognise that the earlier young people are exposed to drug or alcohol use, the more likely they are to run into problems. If a teenager or young adult continues to use drugs or alcohol despite negative consequences; they may need help with addiction.</p>

<p class="description" style="color:white;">In some cases this is possible. However, at the point that the life of both the individual, their family, partner and friends are affected; it is likely that the problem has progressed to a stage where intervention will be required to help prevent further damage. Addiction changes the brain and adversely affects development young adults. Stopping is difficult, even when exhaustion and a desire to change set in. In some cases, that desire is not evident. Addiction changes the way that we perceive the world. It changes the way that we experience pleasure. Medical imaging is able to show changes in the structure and internal systems of long term substance users. The reward system in the brain is affected. Critical  thinking, decision making skills, learning, memory and the pleasure centres show changes following sustained drug and alcohol use. Stopping becomes difficult and sometimes dangerous. Addiction is not a choice. It is a medical condition much like any other.</p>
